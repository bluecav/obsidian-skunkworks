# Styling markmind.js

Certainly! Styling in `markmind.js`, which is a JavaScript library used for creating mind maps and similar structures, can be quite versatile when combined with CSS. Here are some examples of how you could define CSS styles to achieve the effects you described:

### 1. Defining Thicker Lines for the Branches

To make the lines that connect nodes in the mind map thicker, you can target the SVG paths or lines directly via CSS. Here's a basic example:

```css
.markmap-link {
    stroke-width: 4px; /* Sets the thickness of the line */
    stroke: #333; /* Color of the line */
}
```

### 2. Text Enclosed in a Border with Rounded Edges

For enclosing text in a border with rounded edges, you need to style the text containers (usually `<div>` elements) that hold the text. Assuming each text block in your mind map has a class like `.markmind-node`, you might style it like this:

```css
.markmap-node {
    border: 2px solid #4A90E2; /* Color of the border */
    border-radius: 10px; /* Rounded edges */
    padding: 5px 10px; /* Padding around the text */
    background-color: #fff; /* Background color of the node */
}

```

### 3. Header Line with Smaller Text Below the Header on Each Branch

To have a header with smaller text below it on each branch, you would first need to ensure your HTML structure supports this, perhaps with a `<span>` or `<div>` for the header and another for the subtext. Hereâ€™s a way you could structure and style it:

```html
<div class="markmind-node">
    <div class="header">Main Idea</div>
    <div class="subtext">Additional details go here.</div>
</div>

```

And the accompanying CSS:

```css
.markmind-node .header {
    font-size: 16px; /* Larger font size for the header */
    font-weight: bold; /* Make the header bold */
}

.markmind-node .subtext {
    font-size: 12px; /* Smaller font size for the subtext */
    color: #666; /* A softer color for the subtext */
}

```

### Implementing the Styles in Your Project

To apply these styles, you would:

1. Ensure your HTML elements generated by `markmind.js` match the selectors used in your CSS (e.g., the class names like `.markmind-node`, `.markmind-path`).
2. Include your CSS in the `<head>` section of your HTML document, or within a linked stylesheet.
3. If `markmind.js` dynamically generates HTML elements after the page has loaded, you may need to apply some styles via JavaScript or ensure that the dynamic elements receive the appropriate classes and structure.

These examples provide a foundation that you can further customize based on your specific requirements and the actual structure of the HTML elements generated by `markmind.js`.
