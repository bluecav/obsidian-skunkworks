title: [Reddit Post](<https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/16d6rud/a_complete_list_of_apps_devoted_to_shortcuts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3>)

This is a random ordered list of iOS/PadOS Apps that offer **most** of their features or functionality via [Shortcuts](https://i.imgur.com/qTJlRra.jpg).

Does **not** include common stand alone apps that offers a couple of actions to shortcuts. HomeKit & Widget related Apps aren’t included either.

I thought it’d be useful having them all in one place.
